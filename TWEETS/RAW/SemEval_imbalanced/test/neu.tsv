623532967214907394	neutral	LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!
624311874792783872	neutral	Further: Zlatan is the captain of the Mon-Stars. (The plot involves him recruiting demons to take over world soccer).
624759382572580864	neutral	@Jon_LeGossip Thoughts about the aubameyang rumors? Cover if Zlatan leaves? Or adding depth? Augustin a good 3rd Striker for UCL quality?

627755947562287104	neutral	Zlatan is a doubt for Friday's game at Lille with sprained ligaments in his knee. He had to be strapped up during the game last night. #PSG
627832922784071680	neutral	@JenniferWegerup Hey Jennifer. What is your source for your article about Zlatan will be in Istanbul on the 6th of aug. Thanks a lot.
627918208956280832	neutral	@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight. May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class.
628338272272519168	neutral	I don't want to wake up tomorrow, without Zlatan. #Galatasaray @Ibra_official
628509722627301376	neutral	Ibra recovery time is still unknown, the French League starts on Friday. PSG will play Lille, Zlatan is very much in doubt for that.
629174827786473472	neutral	@DivinityHope Sure, someone who scored more goals than Zlatan and Edinson would be 4th string lol you retard

630817148751978496	neutral	@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway.
631192740089311232	neutral	@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?
632489375708905472	neutral	@Paulkurth that 3rd shot looks like its from a Michael Bay movie. Zlatan just revealed himself to be Optimus prime.
633561966997577728	neutral	Apparently Zlatan may leave PSG for United. He's already at a team that buys every high rate payer and wins fuck all, not sure why he'd go.
634032590077460480	neutral	OH NO, we supposedly pull out of Pedro deal as Zlatan becomes available. Please god I'll go church every Sunday if u make this not happen

635220412155105280	neutral	@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
636255247992758272	neutral	@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore
637317102513295360	neutral	@BumperGraham with mario rejoining Milan surely there's no room for 2nd reunion with Zlatan which therefore clears the path straight to utd

639016598477651968	neutral	@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
640276909633486849	neutral	Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
