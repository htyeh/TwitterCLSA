Summary of multilingual experiments

Two target languages are chosen, each using different other languages for external signals
  - De, adding Hu, Sk, Sv
  - Es, adding It, Pt

For De, Hu, Sk and Sv, a set of "normal sized" experiments and another set of "small sized" experiments are performed
  - normal: uses ~5000 De and ~1500 Hu/Sk/Sv each
  - small: uses ~300 De/Hu/Sk/Sv each

Four configurations of multilingual zero-shot
  - sequential + no De dev set
  - sequential + use De dev set
  - joint + no De dev set
  - joint + use De dev set
  * "sequential" seperates zero-shot into two training sessions, first with En and then with external langs; "joint" means En and external langs are merged for training; "no De dev" or "use De dev" indicates whether a De dev set or another dev set is used during zero-shot training
  - findings are that sequential training is better than joint training and using a De dev set is better than other dev sets (En and Sv dev sets are used for comparison)
  - concretely: "sequential" + De or En dev set increases De zero-shot scores; "sequential" + Sv dev set increases De zero-shot macro slightly while decreasing De zero-shot micro; "joint" decreases De zero-shot scores in all settings

Multilingual for Spanish
  - For Es only a set of "small sized" experiments are performed, using ~300 Es/It/Pt each
  - External langs either used after En traning (sequential + Es dev set) or merged with En during training (joint + En dev set)
  - Both settings decreases Es micro and increases Es macro

A multilingual classifier
  - ~35000 En and ~300 each of all the 7 other langs are used to train a classifier for all 8 langs
  - 7 langs are added one by one to tune the classifier trained on En
  - scores for almost all langs increase consistantly for each additional language added
